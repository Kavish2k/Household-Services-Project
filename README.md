3. **Frontend Development**: Leveraged HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and responsive user interface, including **frontend validation on forms** for better user experience and data integrity.
4. **Controllers Development**: Handled different user roles using Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy.
5. **Testing**: Utilized dummy data to verify the backend and frontend functionality.
